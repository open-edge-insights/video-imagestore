# `ImageStore Module`

The Image Store component of EII comes as a separate container which primarily
subscribes to the stream that comes out of the VideoAnalytics app via EII
MessageBus and stores the frame into minio for historical analysis.

The high level logical flow of ImageStore is as below:
1. The messagebus subscriber in ImageStore will subscribe to the VideoAnalytics
   published classified result (metadata, frame) on the messagebus.
   The img_handle is extracted out of the metadata and is used as the key and
   the frame is stored as a value for that key in minio persistent storage.
2. For historical analysis of the stored classified images, ImageStore starts
   the messagebus server which provides the read and store interfaces.
   The payload format is as follows for:
   * Store interface:
     ```
        Request: map ("command": "store","img_handle":"$handle_name"),[]byte($binaryImage)
        Response : map ("img_handle":"$handle_name", "error":"$error_msg") ("error" is optional and available only in case of error in execution.)
     ```
   * Read interface:
     ```
        Request : map ("command": "read", "img_handle":"$handle_name")
        Response : map ("img_handle":"$handle_name", "error":"$error_msg"),[]byte($binaryImage) ("error" is optional and available only in case of error in execution. And $binaryImage is available only in case of successful read)
     ```

## `Configuration`

All the ImageStore module configuration are added into etcd (distributed
key-value data store) under `AppName` as mentioned in the
environment section of this app's service definition in docker-compose.

If `AppName` is `ImageStore`, then the app's config would look like as below
 for `/ImageStore/config` key in Etcd:
 ```
    "/ImageStore/config": {
        "minio":{
           "accessKey":"admin",
           "secretKey":"password",
           "retentionTime":"1h",
           "retentionPollInterval":"60s",
           "ssl":"false"
        }
    }
 ```
